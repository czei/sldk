Portions of the displayio API implementation are inspired by CircuitPython's displayio module.

The following components are influenced by CircuitPython's implementation:
- displayio module API structure
- Display, Group, Bitmap, Palette, and TileGrid class interfaces
- Font rendering approach for BDF files
- Text display components API

Note: This is a clean-room implementation in Python/Pygame that provides API compatibility
with CircuitPython's displayio module, but does not contain any direct code from CircuitPython.
