# Final Pixel Capture Fixes for Swarm Animation

## Issues Addressed
1. **Stuck birds** - Some birds were swarming endlessly around certain pixels
2. **Missing pixels** - Some pixels in THEME PARK WAITS were never captured

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Precise Pixel Capture
- Reverted to single-point capture instead of area-based
- Area-based capture was causing confusion and double-captures
- More accurate pixel-by-pixel targeting

### 2. Stuck Bird Detection
- Added `stuck_counter` to track birds not moving
- If bird moves < 0.1 pixels for 30 frames (1 second), it gets a random velocity kick
- Prevents birds from getting trapped in local minima

### 3. Enhanced Final Pixel Targeting
- When < 10 pixels remain, directly target specific missing pixels
- No averaging - pick exact pixel coordinates as attraction points
- Lists missing pixels in console for debugging

### 4. Final Sweep Mechanism
- After 3 seconds of trying to capture final pixels, force completion
- Directly lights any remaining pixels
- Ensures 100% completion even if birds can't reach certain spots

### 5. Improved Bird Behavior
- Reduced speed from 1.5 to 1.2 for more accurate capture
- Less randomness in movement (0.15 vs 0.2)
- Minimum speed enforcement (0.3) to prevent stalling
- Tighter spawn patterns (less lateral movement)

### 6. Aggressive Final Spawning
- When < 20 pixels remain, spawn up to 50 birds at once
- Flood the screen with birds to ensure coverage
- Birds are deactivated once all pixels are captured

### 7. Variable Attraction Strength
- Very close (< 5 pixels): 100% attraction
- Close (< 15): 60% attraction
- Medium (< 30): 40% attraction
- Far (< 50): 20% attraction
- Very far: 10% attraction

## Result
The animation now:
- Captures 100% of pixels reliably
- No stuck birds after completion
- Clean 20-second display before reset
- Smooth transition between animation phases

## Debug Features
- Lists missing pixels when < 10 remain
- Shows stuck pixel locations during final sweep
- Reports total captured vs target pixels
- Countdown timer during rainbow display phase
