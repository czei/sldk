# Flocking Behavior Implementation

## Changes Made to Add Visible Swarming/Flocking

### 1. Implemented Classic Boids Algorithm
Added three flocking rules to each bird:
- **Separation**: Birds steer away from neighbors within 5 pixels
- **Alignment**: Birds match velocity with neighbors within 15 pixels  
- **Cohesion**: Birds steer toward center of neighbors within 20 pixels

### 2. Balanced Forces
- Flocking forces start strong, attraction to pixels starts weak
- As more pixels are captured, attraction gradually increases
- Formula: `attraction_weight = 0.1 + (captured_ratio * 0.5)`
- Force weights: Separation (0.4), Alignment (0.3), Cohesion (0.2)

### 3. Group Spawning
- Birds spawn in tight clusters of 5 (FLOCK_SPAWN_SIZE)
- All birds in a spawn group start at similar positions with similar velocities
- This encourages natural flock formation from the start

### 4. Progressive Bird Count
- Early stage (< 30% complete): Only 30 birds active
- Mid stage (30-60% complete): 60 birds active
- Late stage: Gradually increase to 150+ birds for final pixels
- Fewer birds early = more visible flocking patterns

### 5. Enhanced Organic Movement
- Wing flapping: `0.15 * sin(phase + time*10)` for X, `0.1 * cos(phase + time*8)` for Y
- Individual speed multipliers (0.7-1.3) for variation
- Random phase offsets for asynchronous flapping
- Increased randomness (Â±0.1) for natural movement

### 6. Visual Improvements
- Birds now use 5-pixel cross shape instead of single pixel
- Spawn interval increased to 0.2s for clearer group formation
- Bird speed increased to 3.0 for more dynamic movement

### 7. Pixel Capture Integration
- When birds are > 3 pixels from targets: Full flocking behavior
- When birds are 1.5-3 pixels from targets: Reduced flocking, increased targeting
- When birds are < 1.5 pixels from targets: Precision mode, ignore flocking

## Result
The animation now shows clear flocking behavior:
- Birds move in cohesive groups
- Groups merge and split naturally
- Swarms circle around before capturing pixels
- Organic, lifelike movement patterns
- Still achieves 100% pixel capture for complete text display

The flocking is most visible in the early stages when there are fewer birds. As the animation progresses and more birds are needed for coverage, the swarms become denser but still maintain flocking characteristics.
