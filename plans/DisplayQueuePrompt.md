AI Prompt: Extensible LED Display Framework
Objective
Create a comprehensive, production-ready Python framework for managing LED displays that can show multiple types of information with different visualization strategies. The framework should be highly extensible, well-documented, and suitable for both hobbyist and commercial applications.
Core Requirements
1. Architecture Foundation

Implement a plugin-based architecture using Strategy, Factory, and Observer patterns
Create abstract base classes for all major components
Support multiple LED hardware backends (WS2812B, HUB75, MAX7219, virtual/simulated)
Provide thread-safe operation for concurrent data sources
Include comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

2. Display System Components
   Required Components:
- DisplayManager: Core orchestrator with queue management
- DisplayStrategy: Base class for all rendering strategies
- DisplayItem: Data container with metadata (priority, duration, transitions)
- DisplayQueue: Priority-based queue with interrupt handling
- HardwareAbstraction: Interface for different LED hardware
- TransitionEngine: Smooth transitions between display items
- ConfigurationManager: YAML/JSON-based configuration system
3. Built-in Display Strategies
   Implement at least 10 core strategies:

Static text (multiple fonts, sizes)
Scrolling text (variable speed, directions)
Time/Clock (analog, digital, with timezone support)
Graph visualizations (line, bar, scatter, realtime)
Progress indicators (bar, circular, custom)
Animations (sprite-based, procedural)
Weather displays (icons, temperature, forecast)
Notification alerts (with urgency levels)
Image/Icon display (with scaling)
Matrix effects (rain, fire, plasma)

4. Extensibility Features
   python# Example of how extensions should work:

@register_strategy('custom_viz')
class CustomVisualization(DisplayStrategy):
def render(self, display, data):
# Custom rendering logic
pass

@register_hardware('my_led_board')
class MyLEDBoard(HardwareInterface):
def write_buffer(self, buffer):
# Hardware-specific implementation
pass

@register_data_source('mqtt')
class MQTTDataSource(DataSource):
def on_message(self, topic, payload):
self.emit_display_item(DisplayItem(...))
5. Queue Management System

Priority levels: IDLE, LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT, SYSTEM
Scheduling: one-time, recurring, conditional, time-based
Expiration handling for time-sensitive content
Queue persistence and recovery
Fair scheduling algorithm to prevent starvation
Support for display groups and sequences

6. Configuration & Customization
   yaml# Example configuration structure
   display:
   hardware:
   type: "ws2812b"
   width: 64
   height: 32
   brightness: 80
   pin: 18

strategies:
clock:
enabled: true
format: "24h"
timezone: "UTC"

weather:
enabled: true
api_key: "${WEATHER_API_KEY}"
update_interval: 900

queue:
max_items: 100
default_duration: 5.0
idle_display: "clock"

themes:
default:
colors:
primary: "#FFFFFF"
alert: "#FF0000"
fonts:
default: "5x7"
large: "8x13"
7. API Design
   python# Simple API for common use cases
   display = LEDDisplayFramework('config.yaml')

# Basic usage
display.show_text("Hello World", duration=3)
display.show_alert("System Update", priority=Priority.HIGH)
display.add_widget('clock', position='top-right')

# Advanced usage
with display.sequence() as seq:
seq.add_text("Loading...", duration=1)
seq.add_progress(0, 100, duration=5)
seq.add_text("Complete!", duration=2)

# Custom data source
@display.data_source('sensor')
async def temperature_monitor():
while True:
temp = read_temperature()
yield DisplayItem('graph', {'value': temp, 'label': 'Â°C'})
await asyncio.sleep(60)
8. Additional Features
   Plugin System

Auto-discovery of plugins in specified directories
Plugin metadata and dependencies
Version compatibility checking
Plugin sandboxing for security

Monitoring & Analytics

Performance metrics (FPS, CPU usage, queue depth)
Display time analytics
Error tracking and reporting
Remote monitoring capabilities

Developer Tools

Virtual/simulated display for development
Web-based preview interface
Hot-reload for strategy development
Comprehensive unit test framework
Performance profiling tools

Documentation Requirements

Getting started guide with examples
API reference with all classes/methods
Plugin development guide
Hardware integration guide
Best practices and patterns
Troubleshooting guide

Technical Constraints

Python 3.8+ compatible
Minimize dependencies (only well-maintained libraries)
Memory-efficient for embedded systems (Raspberry Pi Zero)
Support both synchronous and asynchronous operation
Include type hints throughout
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

Deliverables

Complete framework source code
Example implementations for common use cases
Unit tests with >80% coverage
Documentation (Sphinx-based)
Docker container for easy deployment
Example hardware integration for Raspberry Pi

Success Criteria

New display strategies can be added in <50 lines of code
Hardware backends can be swapped without changing application code
Queue can handle 1000+ items without performance degradation
Transitions are smooth at 30+ FPS
Memory usage stays under 100MB for typical usage
Setup to working display takes <10 minutes

Example Use Cases to Support

Home information dashboard (time, weather, calendar)
Server monitoring display (metrics, alerts)
Retail price displays (products, promotions)
Transportation signs (arrivals, delays)
Notification center (multiple apps/services)
Art installations (generative visuals)


Please create this framework with production-quality code, emphasizing clean architecture, extensibility, and ease of use. Include comprehensive error handling, logging, and configuration validation. The framework should be suitable for open-source release and community contribution.
