# Scrolling LED Dev Kit (SLDK) - Comprehensive Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates the plan to refactor the Theme Park Waits application to extract generic LED development functionality into a reusable library called "Scrolling LED Dev Kit" (SLDK). The library will provide a complete development environment for creating CircuitPython-based scrolling LED applications with modern development tools, debugging capabilities, and deployment features.

## Project Goals

1. **Create a reusable library** for developing scrolling LED applications
2. **Maintain compatibility** with both CircuitPython hardware and desktop development
3. **Optimize for ESP32 constraints** - ~200KB available RAM, single-core performance
4. **Provide modern development tools** including debugging, simulation, and hot-reload
5. **Enable easy deployment** with OTA updates and web-based configuration
6. **Support extensibility** through clean interfaces and plugin architecture

## ESP32-First Design Philosophy

The library follows an "ESP32-first" design approach - if it runs well on the constrained ESP32 hardware, it will run excellently in the development environment. This ensures that code written and tested on desktop will work reliably when deployed to hardware.

### ESP32/CircuitPython Constraints

The library must work within severe hardware limitations:
- **Memory**: Only ~200KB RAM available after CircuitPython loads
- **Performance**: Single-threaded, 240MHz, but Python overhead is significant  
- **Storage**: .py files loaded into RAM, so code size directly impacts available memory
- **No true multithreading**: Only cooperative async via asyncio
- **Slow I/O**: Network operations can block for seconds

## Architecture Overview

### Three-Process Architecture

The library implements a three-process async architecture for optimal performance and separation of concerns:

1. **Display Process** - Handles all display rendering at consistent frame rate
   - Runs at 50+ FPS for smooth animations
   - Never blocked by network operations
   - Consumes content from thread-safe queue
   - Manages display hardware/simulator

2. **Data Update Process** - Manages data fetching and updates in the background
   - Fetches data on configurable intervals
   - Updates content queue atomically
   - Handles API failures gracefully
   - Sends notifications to other processes

3. **Web Server Process** - Provides web UI for configuration and monitoring
   - Non-blocking web interface
   - Real-time configuration updates
   - Status monitoring and debugging
   - WebSocket support for live updates

## Hardware Support Strategy

SLDK is designed to support any CircuitPython-compatible LED matrix display through a flexible two-tier approach:

### Tier 1: Application-Specific Hardware

For custom setups, users can override the `create_display()` method in their application:

```python
class MyApp(SLDKApp):
    async def create_display(self):
        return MyCustomDisplay()  # User's hardware implementation
```

### Tier 2: Library Contributions

For widely-used hardware, device drivers are contributed to SLDK:

```python
# sldk/display/devices/new_device.py
class NewDeviceDisplay(DisplayInterface):
    # Hardware-specific implementation
```
