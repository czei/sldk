# Complete Pixel Capture Fixes for Swarm Animation

## Problem
Letters like A, I, and T in "WAITS" were showing up incomplete with missing pixels. The issue was random, suggesting timing/race conditions.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Discrete vs Continuous Space**: Birds move in floating-point coordinates but pixels are integers
2. **Narrow Structures**: Letters like 'I' (only 2 pixels wide) cause birds to oscillate around x=31.5
3. **Timing Issues**: Race conditions between bird capture and bitmap updates
4. **Insufficient Coverage**: Not enough birds targeting final pixels

## Complete Solution Applied

### 1. Precision Targeting Mode
```python
# When within 3 pixels of target, switch to precision mode
if closest_target and min_dist < 3:
    if min_dist < 1.5:
        # Very slow movement (30% speed)
        self.vx = dx * 0.3
        self.vy = dy * 0.3
    else:
        # Moderate speed (50%)
        self.vx = (dx / min_dist) * 0.5
        self.vy = (dy / min_dist) * 0.5
    # Minimal randomness (±0.01 instead of ±0.1)
```

### 2. Radius-Based Capture
```python
check_radius = 0.8  # Increased from exact match
# Capture ALL pixels within radius, not just one
for px, py in target_pixels:
    if (px, py) not in captured_pixels:
        dist = math.sqrt((self.x - px)**2 + (self.y - py)**2)
        if dist <= check_radius:
            captured_pixels.add((px, py))
```

### 3. Aggressive Final Sweep
- Starts when ≤ 20 pixels remain (was 10)
- Timeout reduced to 2 seconds (was 3)
- Force-lights any remaining pixels
- Prints which pixels were force-lit for debugging

### 4. Enhanced Bird Management
- Maintain high bird count even near completion (150+ birds)
- Spawn 40 birds at a time (was 20)
- Spawn interval reduced to 0.05s (was 0.1s)
- Target cycling through missing pixels

### 5. Bitmap Update Guarantee
- Update ALL captured pixels every frame
- Final verification when marking complete
- Force-update any black pixels in target set

### 6. Verification & Debugging
- Warning if animation ends with missing pixels
- List missing pixels on reset
- Fix unlit pixels during completion check

## Result
The animation now guarantees 100% pixel capture through:
1. Precise bird control near targets
2. Radius capture to handle boundary cases
3. Aggressive spawning to flood difficult areas
4. Multiple safety nets to catch any missed pixels
5. Forced completion for any stubborn pixels

The hardware acceleration benefits are maintained while ensuring visual completeness.
