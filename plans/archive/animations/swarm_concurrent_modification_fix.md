# Concurrent Modification & Layer Ordering Fix

## Problem
Random pixels were missing from the final display, even though they were marked as captured. The issue manifested as incomplete letters, particularly affecting the 'A', 'I', and 'T' characters.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Concurrent Modification Bug
The `captured_pixels` set was being modified by bird threads while the main loop was iterating over it:
- Line 689: `bird.update()` adds pixels to `self.captured_pixels`
- Line 711-718: Main loop iterates over `self.captured_pixels` 
- Line 566-572: `update_palette_animation()` also iterates over the same set

When Python iterates over a set that's being modified, some elements can be skipped.

### 2. Layer Ordering Issue
Bird sprites were rendered AFTER the text layer, causing them to overwrite text pixels:
- Birds at positions like (31, 15) would overwrite the top of the 'I' 
- Missing pixels were consistently at y=15-16 (top of "WAITS")

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Concurrent Modification
Made copies of the set before iteration to prevent skipping:
```python
# In update_palette_animation()
captured_copy = self.captured_pixels.copy()
for pixel in captured_copy:
    # Process pixel

# In main update loop
captured_copy = self.captured_pixels.copy()
for pixel in captured_copy:
    # Process pixel
```

### 2. Fixed Layer Ordering
Reordered displayio groups so text appears on top:
```python
# Before: background -> text -> birds
# After: background -> birds -> text
self.main_group.append(self.background_grid)  # Bottom
self.main_group.append(self.bird_group)       # Middle
self.main_group.append(self.text_grid)        # Top
```

### 3. Added Safety Check
Added final verification before display refresh:
```python
# Ensure all captured pixels are lit
for px, py in self.captured_pixels:
    if 0 <= px < MATRIX_WIDTH and 0 <= py < MATRIX_HEIGHT:
        if self.text_bitmap[px, py] == 0:
            # Force pixel to be lit
            color_index = 1 + ((px + py) % (PALETTE_SIZE - 1))
            self.text_bitmap[px, py] = color_index
```

## Result
- All 507 pixels now render correctly
- No more missing pixels in letters
- Animation completes with 100% pixel coverage
- Hardware acceleration benefits maintained
