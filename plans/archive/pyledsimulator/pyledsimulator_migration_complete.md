# PyLEDSimulator to SLDK Migration - Complete

## Migration Summary

Successfully completed the migration from PyLEDSimulator to SLDK's built-in simulator. This consolidation removes redundancy and confusion by using a single LED simulator implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Renaming
- **Renamed**: `src/ui/pyledsimulator_display.py` â†’ `src/ui/sldk_simulator_display.py`
- **Reason**: The file was misleadingly named - it was actually using SLDK simulator, not PyLEDSimulator

### 2. Display Factory Updates
- **Updated**: `src/ui/display_factory.py` to import from the renamed file
- **Changes**: 
  - Import path: `from src.ui.sldk_simulator_display import SLDKSimulatorDisplay`
  - Log message: "Falling back to SLDK simulator display"

### 3. Example Migration
Successfully migrated all swarm examples from PyLEDSimulator to SLDK:
- `theme_park_waits_swarm.py`
- `theme_park_waits_swarm_advanced.py`
- `theme_park_waits_swarm_circuitpython.py`
- `theme_park_waits_swarm_gif.py`
- `theme_park_waits_swarm_gif_hq.py`
- `theme_park_waits_swarm_sprites.py`
- `complete_swarm_demo.py`
- `theme_park_waits_simple_swarm.py`
- `generate_swarm_frames.py`
- `play_swarm_frames.py`
- `circuitpython_swarm_player.py`

All examples now use:
```python
from sldk.simulator.devices import MatrixPortalS3
```

### 4. SLDK Examples Fixed
Fixed two SLDK examples that incorrectly imported from PyLEDSimulator:
- `sldk/examples/simulator/scrolling_text_example.py`
- `sldk/examples/simulator/dual_zone_example.py`

### 5. Directory Structure
- **Created**: `sldk/examples/swarm/` directory
- **Moved**: All swarm examples to this new location
- **Deleted**: PyLEDSimulator directory entirely

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Only one LED simulator implementation to maintain
2. **Clear Architecture**: SLDK is the scrolling LED development kit that includes its own simulator
3. **Reduced Confusion**: No more wondering which simulator to use
4. **Easier Maintenance**: All simulator code in one place

## API Compatibility

The migration was seamless because both simulators had nearly identical APIs:
- Same device classes (MatrixPortalS3)
- Same display methods (initialize, clear, set_pixel, run)
- Same displayio components
- Same color constants

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to verify everything works correctly
2. Update any remaining documentation that references PyLEDSimulator
3. Consider creating a hardware-accelerated version of the swarm animation using displayio/rgbmatrix features for CircuitPython (see `swarm_animation_optimization_plan.md`)

## Historical Context

PyLEDSimulator was created before SLDK existed. When SLDK was developed, it included its own simulator but PyLEDSimulator remained as a historical artifact. This migration completes the consolidation that should have happened when SLDK was introduced.
