# Boot and Code.py Changes Summary

## Problem
The release system can only update files in the `/src` directory, but `boot.py` and `code.py` are fixed from release1.9. The current codebase needs to work with these fixed files.

## Solution

### 1. Created Bridge Module
- Created `src/themeparkwaits.py` as a bridge module
- This module is imported by the fixed `code.py` from release1.9
- It sets up the Python path and imports the main application

### 2. Updated code.py
- Changed from the swarm animation demo to the simple release1.9 version:
  ```python
  import src.themeparkwaits
  ```

### 3. Preserved Original Files
- Renamed `code_simple.py` to `code_swarm_demo.py`
- Saved full swarm demo as `code_swarm_demo_full.py`
- Kept `code_entry.py` as an alternative entry point

### 4. Updated Makefile
- Changed deployment targets to copy the new simple `code.py`
- Both `copy-to-circuitpy` and `copy-to-circuitpy-no-lint` now use the correct file

## How It Works
1. CircuitPython runs `boot.py` (unchanged from release1.9)
2. CircuitPython runs `code.py` which contains `import src.themeparkwaits`
3. `src/themeparkwaits.py` sets up the environment and imports `theme_park_main.py`
4. `theme_park_main.py` runs the main application

## Testing
The import chain was tested and works correctly. The application starts up properly when `src.themeparkwaits` is imported.

## Important Notes
- Do NOT modify `boot.py` or `code.py` in future releases
- All application code must be in the `/src` directory or imported from there
- The `src/themeparkwaits.py` bridge module enables compatibility with the fixed entry points
